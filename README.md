# Some heuristics for the traveling salesman problem
* The code for testing is in Run.java
* Every other algoritm is in its respective file.
* The results and instances are in the TSP file.
* The current TSP file reader does **not** support all types of TSPs.
* Currently every algoritm is "decently" commented as how it works except LK, which is a mess (but it does work as it should).
